OptReq1,SciReq1,Must allow for the maximum beam diameter and allow for mirror removal without damage
OptReq2,SciReq1,M1 mirror obscuration from M2 and support structures (vanes) must be less than 1/3 total 
OptReq3,SciReq1,M1 mirror must fit within the max diameter of re-aluminising chamber (4.2m)
OptReq4,SciReq2,Mirror coatings must be industry standard aluminium providing consistent performance across the required wavelength spectrum
OptReq5,,The telescope mirror(s) will require re-coating at regular intervals
OptReq6,,Baffle designs must be optimised across full wavelength range and balance optical and infra-red requirements
OptReq7,,The baffle design should not adversely affect image quality
OptReq8,,The telescope will be a Richley-Chretien (RC) design
OptReq9,,The f-ratio will be 7.5 with f/1.75 M1
OptReq10,,The back focal distance will be 2.5m
OptReq11,,Two autoguiders will allow closed loop tracking in both Alt rotation and Cass rotation
OptReq12,,Closed loop tracking with autoguiders will allow stable tracking over 50 minutes
OptReq13,,"With a segmented M1 mirror, phasing will be required to ensure the mirrors are co-phased. Actuators must allow phasing in the order of lamda/4 =100nm"
OptReq14,,Distance between top of M1 'bowl' and elevation axis shall be >0.3m and less than 1m.
